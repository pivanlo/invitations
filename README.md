## Proudest achievement

My proudest achievement is probably _Discoverible_. Discoverible was a web application that allowed YouTube users to organize their video collections using tags and faceted classification. This was my first big personal project. I created it during 2013. At that time I was learning a lot of new technologies (SPAs, Ruby on Rails, and many more). I remember that the biggest challenge was implementing the faceted search. I started with PostgreSQL and soon found out that it wasn't the right tool for the job. So I learned Elasticsearch and was able to run it as a service on a cloud hosting service where I had to do all the backend management. It was the first time I was managing a web server (I had been using Heroku until then).
The result was a very fast search engine and a sofware architecture like I never had done before. This project taught me that many things that intimidated me were actually approachable and very valuable. In addition to the more technical skills, I also learn about problem solving and I learned that good products are not built for the users, they are built _with_ the users.
